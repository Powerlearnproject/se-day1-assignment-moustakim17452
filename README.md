#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Soft Engineering is an systematic applied to engineering principles, methods and tools to develop or built and maintain high quality software application or systems. It involves system software design, development, testing deployment and maintainance. It main importances is to develop and maintain system solutions for business processes, operations in health and accounting and entertainment industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of Agile Systems:
Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, plan-driven software development models like Waterfall. Agile promotes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, with a focus on delivering small, functional pieces of software quickly and continuously improving them.
Introduction of Structural Programs:
A paradigm shift that prioritized simple, hierarchical program design was called structured programming. It was first introduced to help make code more readable, dependable, and maintainable. This method discouraged the usage of "goto" commands, which frequently resulted in a jumbled and unmanageable code structure.
Object-Oriented Programming's Inception:
Object-oriented programming, gives priority to objects above actions. These objects, which encompases both data and behaviors, are representations of real-world issues.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning Statge: This involves defining project scope, objectives and goals and challenges. It takes into consideration, feasibility studies, risk assessment and mitigation and allocating resources. A detail plan to guide the entire development process.
2. Requirement Analysis: This stage includes functional and non-fuctional requirements are obtained and gathered. It as at this stage prospective clients, end-users and other stakeholders create input on what the software should solve.
3. Design: This stage involves the creation of system architecture and design specification. Moreover, its structure, components, interfaces and data model. The importance is to ensure the guidance of the development process and meet stakeholders requirement.
4. Implementation: During this stage, the developers follow the design specifications when writing code. The program is constructed in parts or modules that are subsequently combined. The aim is to bring or translate the design into fuctional product software.
5. Testing: The software goes through unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, inorder to identify and fix defects.
6. Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed into an usage environment, where user's could use it, which means it is ready.
7. Maintaenance: At this stage, the software is monitored for issues,fixes, bugs and updates, inorder for the software to continue to be functional and meets needless users needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodologies involves sequential approach, where one software development life cycle, requires to be completed before moving to the next and cannot be revised once finished, changes in design are difficult once the project has began, whiles Agile follows iterative approach that create the division of the project into smaller chnuks called sprints and allow for changes, requirements and design late in the development stage, enabling provision for stakeholders needs. Examples of Waterfall Methodologies are construction of manufacturing software and banking compliance software. Examples of Agile methodologies are the development of mobile and web app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: 
Design and Develop Software: Write, test, and maintain code in accordance with the given specification and requirements. Create additional software features and functionalities.
Document Code: To aid with comprehension and future maintenance by writing and maintain code documentation that includes comments and explanations.
Debugging and Troubleshooting:Identify, assess, and fix any coding faults or issues. An effective tool for problem solution is the usage of debugging tools and procedures.

Quality Assurance Engineer:
Perform Testing: Run both automatic and human tests to make sure the software is error-free, meets requirements, and operates as intended. Check to see if the program performs as anticipated in various settings.
Develop Test Plans and Cases: Based on the requirements and specifications, create thorough test strategies, test cases, and test scripts. Create tests, such as functional, integration, and performance tests, to cover a range of scenarios.
Verify Fixes:To make sure that developer modifications and bug fixes resolve existing issues and don't cause new ones, test and validate them.

Project Manager: 
Project Planning and Scheduling: Create thorough project plans that include schedules, goals, and the distribution of resources. Define the objectives, deliverables, and scope of the project in conjunction with the stakeholders.
Coordinate and Communicate: Serve as a point of contact for stakeholders, other departments, and the development team. Encourage communication, control expectations, and make sure that everyone is on the same page regarding the project's objectives.
Monitor Progress: Monitor the project's development, spot any dangers or problems, and make sure it stays on budget and on schedule. To keep an eye on assignments and due dates, use project management tools.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments:
1.IDEs frequently come with robust debugging features that let programmers navigate through code line by line, check variables, and set breakpoints. This facilitates problem identification and resolution. Integrated testing frameworks are supported by a lot of IDEs, allowing developers to write and execute tests right in the environment.
2.IDEs are flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of languages, frameworks, and workflows thanks to plugins and extensions.
3.Multiple developers can work on the same codebase at once with real-time collaboration features included in some current integrated development environments (IDEs). This is especially helpful for remote teams.
4.IDEs give developers an entire toolkit in one interface, making it easier for them to write, test, debug, and publish code. The development workflow is streamlined as a result of this connection, which minimizes the need to transition between several programs.
Version Control Systems:
1.With version control systems (VCS), developers can collaborate on the same codebase at the same time without erasing each other's edits. Teams can work independently on various features or bug fixes before incorporating them into the main source by using branching and merging features.
2.Every change made to the codebase is tracked by VCS, along with the maker and reason for the change. This history is quite helpful in figuring out how the code changed over time, going back to earlier iterations, and pinpointing the exact moment and location of issue introductions.
3.In the event of a system outage or other problem, VCS offers a dependable backup of the whole codebase, guaranteeing that no work is lost. In the event that something goes wrong, developers can go back to earlier iterations of the code.
4.Building, testing, and deploying code is automated through VCS's integration with CI/CD pipelines. The deployment of only dependable, tested code to production is guaranteed by this integration.

Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, etc. Examples of Vision Control Systems are Git, Subversion, Etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Ensuring code quality in terms of bug, performance and maintainabilty issue. It can be overcome by implementing unit testing and integration testing, inorder to detect issues early.
2. Managing complex system; systems can be complex and difficult to maintain them as they grow due to debbuging. It can be managed by breaking down the system into smaller, manageable modules inorder to simplify development and maintenance.
3. Security and Privacy Issues: It involves ensuring the software is secure and comply with privacy regulations which involves ongoing concern in a case of high compliance regulated country like USA , in the case of Tik Tok. It challenges can be overcome, by staying informed with up to date compliance requirement and penetration testing in detecting potential security threats or issues.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: It include testing separate software sections or components separately. Generally speaking, a "unit" is the smallest bit of code (function, method, or class) that can be tested separately and independently. It imporatnce is to encourage developers to write well-structured code and ensure that changes or modification to code do not change the existing functionalities and requirements. 

Integration: It focuses on confirming the interfaces and interactions between various software modules or components. It guarantees that when components are integrated, they operate as intended. It helps disclose problems arising from the integration of units and the compartibility of different part of the system devloped by different team.

System Testing: It is the procedure for making sure the integrated system as a whole satisfies the requirements of the system and design. It ensures the whole system is stable and ready for realease and ensure the system works as intended in the user's environment.

Acceptance Testing: Performed to ascertain as to whether the software meets the acceptable criteria as defined by end-user or stakeholders. It ensures the software meets the requirement of the intended users of their business requirement or processes and ensure the system is built properly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is simply a text used to obtained natural response from a model language. It designed to ask specific question with a precise instructions. Just like a receipy to cook yam. It is important to extablish a clear communication between machines and human. E.g Chatbox, Question answer system and language interpreter.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Can you give me some advice?
Can you give me some advice on cash management?

The second prompt is more improve due to the fact it specifically ask for advice for a specific aspect, whiles the fist vague prompt do not specify which type of advice, which mean different response might be given that does not needed by the user.
